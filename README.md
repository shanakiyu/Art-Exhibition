# Art-Exhibition

We created a virtual art exhibition on Minecraft titled “When Everything Fades: The Art of Finitude” or originaly "Quand tout s'efface : l'Art de la Finitude".
The project began with selecting artworks across the city of Paris, following an eco-friendly, low-carbon approach. We then designed the entire exhibition layout, wrote both the standard and children’s labels (available only in French), and built the full scenography inside Minecraft as a guided path. The experience explores ideas of impermanence and the ephemeral — but we’ll let you discover how on your own.

Below are the instructions to access and navigate the exhibition world:

### • Go to the point –2057 / 94 / –302.
The path is usually quite clear and marked by lights. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out.

### • Introductory texts appear when you walk over pressure plates — they’re indicated by pink arrows.
The text fades after a few seconds; if you want it to stay on screen, press T.

### • Wall labels are contained in books placed on bookshelves near each artwork.
When there are two books, the second one is the children’s label.

### • For the finale, activate the lever and look at the building.

# How to access the Minecraft world

I’ve sent you the folder containing the map. Loading a custom world in Minecraft can sometimes be tricky, so here’s a quick guide:

### 1. Make sure you have Minecraft Java Edition installed.
(Other versions like Bedrock or console editions won’t work.)

### 2. Locate your “saves” folder:

On Mac: ~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/saves

On Windows: %appdata%/.minecraft/saves

### 3. Place the exhibition folder inside the “saves” directory.

### 4. Launch Minecraft → Java Edition → Singleplayer → select the world.

If loading the world turns out to be too complicated, we can absolutely find another way for you to visit our exhibition.
